### Frontend Logic (`app.js`)
- Handles frontend initialization on page load
- Manages system status updates dynamically
- Controls user actions such as Generate Timetable, View Timetable, and Clear actions
- Provides demo/offline mode handling when backend is unavailable
- Renders a sample timetable using mock data to validate visualization logic

### UI Foundation
- Basic page layout with status, actions, and results sections
- Button-based interactions connected to frontend logic
- Clean and readable styling for demo and review purposes

### Visualization (Basic)
- Tabular timetable view implemented
- Demonstrates how timetable data will be rendered in the UI
